    </p>
    <p class="description">
        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums 
        <strong>Taylor Swift (2006)</strong> and <strong>Fearless (2008)</strong>. The singles 
        <em>"Teardrops on My Guitar"</em>, <em>"Love Story"</em>, and <em>"You Belong with Me"</em> 
        found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on 
        <strong>Speak Now (2010)</strong> and electronic on <strong>Red (2012)</strong>, later 
        re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 
        <strong>1989 (2014)</strong>. The ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued 
        <strong>Reputation (2017)</strong>. The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles 
        <em>"Shake It Off"</em>, <em>"Blank Space"</em>, <em>"Bad Blood"</em>, and 
        <em>"Look What You Made Me Do"</em>.
